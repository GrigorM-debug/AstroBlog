# AstroBlog
This is a personal blog website built using **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**, following the tutorial provided in the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build). The blog site is designed to be fast, minimalistic, and SEO-friendly, with support for generating RSS feeds and static pages for easy content publishing.

Here, Iâ€™d like to share a link to a fantastic site built by [**Takuya Matsuyama**](https://github.com/craftzdog/), a solo developer from Japan, known for creating the Markdown note-taking app **Inkdropto**. This site is an excellent example of Astro's power in creating fast and minimalistic websites.

## ðŸš€ About Astro
**Astro** is a modern, performance-focused static site builder that allows you to create websites that ship zero client-side JavaScript by default.

Astro is perfect for building:

- Blogs
- Documentation sites
- Portfolio sites
- Simple marketing pages
- Any static site that benefits from great performance
