# AstroBlog
This is a personal blog website built using **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**, following the tutorial provided in the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build). The blog site is designed to be fast, minimalistic, and SEO-friendly, with support for generating RSS feeds and static pages for easy content publishing.

Here I will put a link to better than my site made by Takuya Matsuyama from Japan, a solo developer making a Markdown note-taking app called Inkdropto. There you can see the power of Astro.

## ðŸš€ About Astro
**Astro** is a modern, performance-focused static site builder that allows you to create websites that ship zero client-side JavaScript by default. It uses a component-based architecture and integrates seamlessly with popular frontend frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, and others, but it only loads JavaScript when necessary.

Astro is perfect for building:

- Blogs
- Documentation sites
- Portfolio sites
- Simple marketing pages
- Any static site that benefits from great performance
